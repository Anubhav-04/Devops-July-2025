In Bash when you declare variables all variables are treated as String

if you use them in arithmetic $(()) then only it will concidered as number

No Spaces around = means 
    name = "sonam" is incorrect syntax

Access variables using $ symbol
Read the input from users using read command

Special variables-

$0 : Script name (file name)
$1,$2,$3 ... --> arguments which passed with script
$# : no of arguments
$@ -> all arguments as a list
$$ --> Process Id for that script when it executes
$? --> Exit status of last command (0=success, 1 exited with some error)
